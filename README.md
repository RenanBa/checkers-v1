# checkers-v1
Update version of Checkers

#### On this project I'm building a Checkers game with:
  1. JavaScript interface independent of the backend (js/application.js).
  2. A controller (js/game.js) to receive data and requests from the interface and manipulate the board.
  3. A complex JS model independent of the interface (js/board.js).
